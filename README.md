# printerQuotes

Script that uses Inspirobot to generate inspirational quotes and print them using a thermal receipt printer! Comes with automatic formatting!

# How to run:

1. Add your particular printer to the script and verify compatibility. (Replace the "Epson ..." with the name of your printer in the Windows driver.)
2. Run the script.
3. Press 'q'.
4. Become *inspired*!

### Has only been tested with Windows. Won't work with Linux because the printer library has been created for Windows only.
